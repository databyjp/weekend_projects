## Fitness training

I'm looking to run a half marathon in 5 months. How much training is required? I've last run a half 6 months ago.

It's cold where I am currently - it's late november in edinburgh. Can I train indoors until it warms up?

Since I'm in Edinburgh, I was hoping to just do strength training until it gets warmer.

It's now January. I've moved to Australia for Jan and Feb months. How should I train before my race that's in the UK in April? My April schedule looks very busy.

It's now May. I've run my race, and now I'm sick of running. Also, I've moved permanently to Portugal. I'd like to stick to weight training. Can you suggest how to change my routines for strength training?
